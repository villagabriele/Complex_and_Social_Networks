# Complex_and_Social_Networks
Homework carried out for the Complex and Social Networks course, Master's degree in Data Science, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Academic Year 2025-26.

## Structure of the repository
For every lab there's a pdf file named instructions_labXX.pdf with the instructions for the homework and the code itself. In some of the folders I avoided uploading some plots or the original data (the PUD database) because they were way too big. However, the necessary plots are shown in the reports and the PUD database can be easily accessed online

## Topics of the labs
The labs cover several topics regarding Social Networks and their analysis. In particular, these are what the labs focus on:
- LAB 01: Introduction to igraph
- LAB 02: Analysis of the degree distribution on PUD database
- LAB 03: Significance of network metrics
- LAB 04: Non-linear regression on dependency trees
- LAB 05: Network dynamics
